# inkscape-pes
Inkscape extension to generate Brother embroidery machine PES files.

To install, put the py files in the Inkscape\share\extensions folder.  Then restart inkscape and then there will be a "soft robotics" menu item in extensions.  This software is still being activly developed and should be in a good solid state by the end of June 2017.
